 # Max Sublist Sum

This code snippet finds the maximum sum of a sublist of a given length in a list of integers.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Importing the `random` Module

```python
import random
```

This line imports the `random` module, which provides functions for generating random numbers.

### 2. Initializing Global Variables

```python
max_value = 0
sublist = []
```

These two global variables are used to keep track of the maximum sum and the corresponding sublist.

### 3. Defining the `get_max_sublist` Function

```python
def get_max_sublist(list_, sublist_len):
```

This function takes two arguments:

* `list_`: The list of integers to search.
* `sublist_len`: The length of the sublist to find.

### 4. Checking if the List is Shorter than the Sublist Length

```python
    if len(list_) <= sublist_len:
        return f"max_sublist= {list_}, sum= {sum(list_)}"
```

If the length of the list is less than or equal to the sublist length, then the entire list is returned as the maximum sublist.

### 5. Iterating Over the List

```python
    else:
        for i in range(len(list_) - (sublist_len - 1)):
```

If the list is longer than the sublist length, then the function iterates over the list, starting from the beginning and ending at the index `len(list_) - (sublist_len - 1)`. This ensures that there are enough elements to form a sublist of length `sublist_len`.

### 6. Creating a Temporary Sublist

```python
            temp = list_[i:i + sublist_len]
```

For each iteration, a temporary sublist `temp` is created by slicing the original list from index `i` to `i + sublist_len`.

### 7. Updating Global Variables

```python
            global max_value
            global sublist

            if max_value < sum(temp):
                max_value = sum(temp)
                sublist = temp
```

The sum of the temporary sublist is calculated and compared to the current maximum value
